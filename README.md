# 2022DSSG

Dear DSSG Selection Committee,

Please find in this repository a work sample for your consideration.

The .do file is a demonstration of a scripting I drafted for a final project in the Fall 2021 semester course in my Applied Economics program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The objective was to use the data found in ecoproduce.dta to study the price elasticity of demand for regular and organic apples.  

These data come from a telephone survey conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University in the late 90s.
The survey was attempting (among other things) to determine the demand for “eco-friendly” apples (aka organic apples).  Families were surveyed and presented with a randomly selected set of fictional prices for regular apples and eco-labeled apples. Respondents were asked how many pounds of each they would purchase at the quoted prices.  The price pairs facing each family were randomly assigned.  In other words, the respondents were presented with prices for the eco-labeled and regular apples, and then asked how much of each kind of apple the family would buy at the given prices.  The survey also asked questions about basic household characteristics (e.g. income, household size).

Thank you,

Alejandro
